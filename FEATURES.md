# Converso - Feature Documentation

**Converso** is a powerful WordPress plugin that connects your website visitors to the right support agent on WhatsApp. It uses intelligent routing and dynamic content to ensure a personalized and effective customer experience.

## 1. Smart Agent Routing
Converso ensures that your visitors always talk to the most relevant person.

- **Geolocation-Based Routing**: Automatically detect where your visitor is coming from (City, State, or Country) and display the agent assigned to that location.
- **Default Agent**: Set a "Default" agent to handle inquiries from locations that don't have a specific agent assigned.
- **Offline Mode**: Manually mark agents as "Offline" to temporarily hide them from the frontend without deleting their profile.

## 2. Multi-Agent Management
Manage your support team efficiently directly from the WordPress dashboard.

- **Unlimited Agents**: Add as many support agents as you need.
- **Agent Profiles**: Customize each agent with:
  - **Name**: Display name.
  - **Phone Number**: WhatsApp number (automatically formatted).
  - **Photo**: Custom avatar or profile picture.
  - **Custom Greetings**: Unique welcome message for each agent.
  - **Location Rules**: Assign specific geographic areas to the agent.

## 3. Dynamic Personalization
Make your chat invitations feel personal and relevant using **Dynamic Fields**.

- **Custom Fields**: Create key-value pairs for dynamic content (e.g., `Promo Code: SUMMER2024`).
- **"Callable" Placeholders**: Each field gets a unique ID (e.g., `{promo_code}`) that you can insert into Agent Greetings.
- **Real-time Replacement**: When a visitor sees the chat button, these placeholders are automatically replaced with the actual values, allowing for dynamic marketing messages or personalized greetings.

## 4. Design & Customization
Match the chat widget to your website's brand and layout.

- **20+ Button Styles**: Choose from a wide variety of pre-designed button styles (ranging from simple icons to detailed cards).
- **Flexible Positioning**: Place the chat widget exactly where you want it:
  - Bottom Right
  - Bottom Left
  - Top Right
  - Top Left
- **Responsive Design**: All buttons are designed to look great on both desktop and mobile devices.

## 5. Seamless WhatsApp Integration
- **One-Click Chat**: Visitors are taken directly to WhatsApp (web or app) with a single click.
- **Pre-filled Messages**: The conversation starts with the agent's specific greeting pre-filled in the message box, encouraging users to send the first message.

## 6. Easy Administration
- **User-Friendly Dashboard**: Clean and intuitive interface for managing all settings.
- **Instant Updates**: Changes to agents and settings are applied immediately.
- **Media Library Integration**: Easily upload and select agent photos using the standard WordPress media manager.
